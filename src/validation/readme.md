Validation Package, v1.0, IREX 10 Identification Track.
==================================================================================================

Purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Validation ensures that libraries submitted to NIST are functioning properly. Validation requires
both NIST and the participant to call the library's exported functions on their respective ends
and ensure the output is identical.


Steps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Participants must compile and execute "validate" and email the output to irex@nist.gov. 

Any discrepencies between your output and NIST's will be reported to the participant and
reasonable attempts will be made to resolve the issue.


Additional Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The images accompanying this validation package are in no way representative of the images that
will be used for benchmarking.

NIST will compile, link, and execute this validation code on CentOS 7.6 (gcc version 4.8.5),
downloadable from http://nigos.nist.gov:8080/evaluations/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1810.iso
